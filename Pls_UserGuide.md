### Downloading Pre-built Binaries

{# release -> [pls for $1]({{release}}/dowload/{{$version}}/pls_v{{$version}}_$2.zip)#}

The easiest way to get {{n}} is by downloading one of the prebuilt binaries from the [Github Releases Page]({{release -> https://github.com/h3rald/pls/releases}}):

- {#release||Mac OS X (x64)||macosx_x64#}
- {#release||Windows (x64)||windows_x64#}
- {#release||Linux (x64)||linux_x64#}

### Building from Source

You can also build {{n}} from source, if there is no pre-built binary for your platform.

To do so, after installing the {{nim}} programming language, you can:

3. Clone the pls [repository](https://github.com/h3rald/pls).
4. Navigate to the [pls](class:dir) repository local folder.
5. Run **nim c -d:release pls.nim**
